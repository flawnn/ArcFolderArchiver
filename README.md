# Arc Folder Archive

A simple tool to allow you to export your precious Arc Folders. You can either choose to export them directly as JSON, or to host them on the application and have a "flattened" version of your .

This is especially for you, if you are hogging folders, want to improve your browser's performance or you want to switch away from Arc, but your folders keep you in the ecosystem.

> [!WARNING]
> This tool is a WIP and may not support all Arc folder types yet. Some folder configurations or content types might not export correctly. Please backup your Arc data before using this tool and verify the exported results. If you encounter any issues, please [report them on GitHub](https://github.com/your-username/arc-folder-archive/issues).


## TODO

- [ ] Add automatic folder cleanup feature with configurable timespan
